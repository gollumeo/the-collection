# The Collection

We all have passions - may it be video games, programming, integrating ~~(but you're probably not human...)~~, listening to your faorite bands, and so on. 
But it may be struggling to talk about those in details, especially when there a lot of informations to share with your friends (or people who are not into that domain at all - which is even harder then). 
This is where we become your **Lord and Savior**! 

## The Project

We will create a script using those languages: 

![languages](assets/images/languages.png)

In this script, we will create an array containing one of our passion (so people might be able to adapt it to their needs), which we will translate into objects. 
Once the first objects are created, we *"just"* have to display those objects in some kind of cards (remember our previous (V-Card)[https://github.com/gollumeo/Profile-Card]?), on a website (in responsive, please). 

Let's don't waste anymore time and head to the **real Project**!
